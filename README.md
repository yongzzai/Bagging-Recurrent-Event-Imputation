## Bagging Recurrent Event Imputation for Repair of Imperfect Event Log with Missing Categorical Events (S.H Sim)

I am not the original author of the BREI algorithm, but I have restored, modified, and maintained the code.<br/>
I can answer questions related to the code, but for questions related to the content of the paper, I recommend contacting the original author, Sunghyun Shim.
