## Bagging Recurrent Event Imputation for Repair of Imperfect Event Log with Missing Categorical Events (S.H Sim)

This code is BREI algorithm that implemented by Y.J Lee. 
There may be differences from the original version which is done by S.H Sim.
I would appreciate it if you could focus on the architecture structure.
